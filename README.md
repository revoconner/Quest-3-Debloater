# Meta Quest 3 Debloater
Debloats Quest 3 VR of Meta's social apps, and disables updates and ad services

## List of apps it disables
- Instagram
- Messenger
- Whatsapp
- Facebook
- Ad service ID
- Updater
- Horizon Worlds


## Why it's needed
Since update v76 you cannot uninstall the social apps, if you do they reinstall within minutes. This disables the apps on the HMD

## What's not disabled
- Store (so that games can be installed)
- People (it can be disabled using lighting launcher anyway)

## Prerequisite
ADB must be enabled and the device must be connected using USB

## How to run
You can download the bat file and run it directly if adb is configured on your pc already. Else download the Meta quest 3 debloater.exe from release and run that, it comes with adb and all necessary files prepackaged.

## Notes
- Last tested on quest 3 update v78
- Packaged using enigma virtual box
- The first time you enable adb (developer setting on oculus phone app) you may have to confirm the prompt on the headset else the device won't connect
